## [[Notes]]
## Chap 1
1. For simple search 128 steps.
For binary search:
2<sup>7</sup> = 128
7 steps.

2. If we double then for simple search its 256 steps and for binary search
its 2 <sup>8</sup> = 256 
8 steps. 

3. O (log n )
4. O(n)
5. O(n)
6. O(n) because we ignore all the other names and sort through every A's in the list.


## Chap 2
1. As there is a lot of insertion using a linked list would be better as it has insertion O(log n).
2. Basically insertion and deletion  of the first element so we use linked list.
3. We would use arrays as binary search requires random access and arrays random access.
4. As we store the list in an array, as the  new inserts are done we have to rearrange the whole array again.
